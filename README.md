# Rare Disease Article Traffic Analysis

## Goal

This project aims to analyze Wikipedia traffic data for articles related to rare diseases. Using data from the Wikimedia Analytics API, I acquired monthly pageview counts for these articles from 2015 to 2024. The analysis includes:
- Identifying articles with the highest and lowest average page views
- Finding articles with the peak page views
- Analyzing articles with the fewest months of data

## Data Source

The data is acquired from the Wikimedia Analytics API's Pageviews API, which provides access to traffic data for articles across the English Wikipedia. For more information on the API, please refer to the [Wikimedia Pageviews API documentation](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Analytics#Pageviews).

This is a subset of the English Wikipedia that represents a large number of articles related to rare diseases. This list of pages was collected by using a database of rare diseases maintained by the National Organization for Rare Diseases (NORD) and matching them to Wikipedia articles that are either about a rare disease or have a section that mentions a rare disease.

## Data Files

The following files are generated by the code:

- **`rare-disease_monthly_mobile_201501-202404.json`**: Contains monthly mobile pageviews for each article.
- **`rare-disease_monthly_desktop_201501-202404.json`**: Contains monthly desktop pageviews for each article.
- **`rare-disease_monthly_cumulative_201501-202404.json`**: Contains the sum of mobile and desktop views for each article.
- **`max_min_avg.png`**: A graph showing the maximum and minimum average pageviews for mobile and desktop.
- **`top_10_peak_page_views.png`**: A graph showing the top 10 articles by peak pageviews for mobile and desktop.
- **`fewest_months_data.png`**: A graph showing the 10 articles with the fewest months of available data for mobile and desktop.

### Data Schema

- **`article`**: The article title (string).
- **`date`**: The date in YYYY-MM format (string).
- **`views`**: The number of page views (integer).

## Known Issues and Considerations

- Some articles may have missing data for certain months, especially in the early years (2015-2017).
- The accuracy of the data depends on the consistency and availability of pageview data from the Wikimedia API.
- The `mobile` data includes both mobile web and mobile app traffic, which are combined in the analysis.
